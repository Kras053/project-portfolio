# portfolio
For this project we started to build our portfolio from a strict given design provided to us in Figma. The design contained no JavaScript but only HTML and CSS since the focus was also on accessability. 

# the project
Structure was very much a key in appling a given design making this a < div >-heavy project.
The accessability tests I used was cross-browser testing, validation with https://validator.w3.org/, audition with WAVE, checking keyboard accessability, screen reader on Android and Crome, 
I also tried to use semantic HTML as much as possible and did a test removing the CSS, and learned more on naming images correctly. 

This was the main requirements:
- The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)
- You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)
- The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

# what
This was a great practice for building a good structure with accessability in mind before implementing styling, how to work with Figma, and also for learning more CSS and how to target the different elements in HTML. 
The accessability validation was a great tool and helped me adjust some things directly.

This project required writing more code than our usual projects, so I am happy that we will continue to improve this project further on so I have time for fixing these things: 
-I got a lot of contrast errors in WAVE due to the red/orange text mostly, so one of the things I will try is to apply a bold-span since the bold styling did not work for me.
-the overlays on the project images overflow for some reason in desktop mode
-use svg for the icons and on desktop mode text under icons
-got warning for article section without heading so will check into this
-more DRY both HTML and in CSS since a lot of repetition is going on here.
